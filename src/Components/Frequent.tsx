                                    Adequate hydration is crucial to an effective weight loss. It boosts metabolism and

                                    promotes satiety. Without proper hydration, fat breakdown and elimination is likely
                                    to get
                                    compromised.

                                    Weight loss per week in a weight loss program can vary significantly from person to

                                    Several factors like high-stress levels, inadequate sleep, and slower metabolic rate
                                    can hinder
                                    weight loss progress, hence affecting the rate of weight lost per week. It also
                                    depends on how
                                    well you are following the program.
                                    However, the average weight lost through our program is 3-5 kg in Females and 4-6 kg
                                    in Males
